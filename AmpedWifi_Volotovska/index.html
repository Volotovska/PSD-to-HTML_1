				Amped WiFi™ is a powerful, efficient, strong WI-FI DEVICE that was developed from a military technology called “signal amped transmission”. This is the same type of technology that you may have all heard about during the heroic rescue of the Thai Soccer Team that was trapped in a cave.
			</div>
			<img src="img/cave.jpg" class="coverImg imgCommon" />
			<div class="ordinaryText">
				One of the problems was that the solid rock walls of the caves blocked all radio transmission, but an Israeli super-high-tech company developed a system that allowed many walkie talkies to capture and boost a weak signal so that it could travel all the way through the cave to all the rescue divers.

			<div class="ordinaryText">
				The average home internet user will experience a drop in signal for WiFi at least once a day. Poor internet coverage across the United States, and within the average American home, is a huge problem. Amped WiFi™ was designed and manufactured to solve this problem.
				<span class="boldText">
					It's easy to install, connects to your existing network, and acts as a signal amplifier.

			<div class="regularTitle">
				The result is twice the network range, and a more consistent, reliable connection.
